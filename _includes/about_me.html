            Having worked primarily with lean & hungry startups, I've found myself embracing their philosphies. While I believe that being a full stack developer empowers me, AI helps me dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to see myself as a proficient software engineer who's primary motivation is building products that are useful and easy to use. Open source stacks motivate me; if I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.

            I love to build.
            I look forward to working with amazing individuals & firms who have fun solving hard engineering problems. 
            Although my core strength is machine learning and full stack, I fancy myself an amateur systems architect with an eye for product design.
